## ------
- Reports
- Online GA
  - proposed alternatives for Wasail: http://www.voteit.se/in-english/
  - Smari has to tweak a few things, if he can't do them before Saturday morning, we'll use VoteIT.
  - The rules of procedure will be approved during the first hours of the meeting, because they could change everything. We'll ask Vojtech if he can help us out drafting them.
  - We should create users for the board on whatever platform ASAP so that we can get familiar to it, set up everything, and help out the delegates with the platform.
  - We decide to hold a tutorial session on the 13th of December.
  - We decide not to hold a Mumble discussion session on top of the asynchronous discussion since this would give a disadvantage to those who cannot attend and would make the point of holding and asynchronous discussion void.

## Next actions
- Mab: talk to voteIT to get support for VoteIT as a backup for wasail
- Mikulas: talk to Vojtech about helping out with rules of procedure
- Muriel: email Smari, make a draft of the timeline and send to the board (deadline next tuesday)
- Tony: install VoteIT (see link above) and configure Wasail so that we can use it
