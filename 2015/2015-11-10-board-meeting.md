* Present: Tony Motakis (came 20:23) Sven Clement, Nina Konvalinka, Tale Haukbjørk, Smari McCarthy
* Excused: Muriel, Mab,

## Agenda:

1. Reports
2. Online GA
3. Mumble meeting (27.11.)

## Reports
Smari attended mumble meeting with German Pirate Party (stresses lack of information, not using mailing public lists)

Sven got access to the bank account, including online banking (only 30 days), the amount (that the previous Board reported is there (will add info on the amount later) transactions can't yet be verified as he only has 30 days of historical access.

## Online GA

Smári has mostly finished setting up the voting system, but it needs hooking into nginx and some final configuration steps. Due to lack of time, he needs help to get it done in a reasonable amount of time.

Tony has a container running nginx on the server, responding to port 80. He will look into hooking it up with the voting system.

## Mumble meeting

Nina: Regarding the mumble meeting initiated by a germany pirate party - we are supposed to promote it via social media (Sven, you made that document, have we ever had the time to go through it and define our "strategy", maybe I've missed it)
Sven: -> yes & no. Promoting an event should be doable with what we have in place. I can do the necessary preparations and send it to the right people.
Nina: That would be great, FB event is already created, we only need to promote it publicly. I can write a post on our wordpress, but I don't have the access to twitter (we all have access to facebook, I think)
Sven: I get to it on Thursday. I'll also send it to our members for further spreading.
Nina: Good, so let's say we keep in touch via mailing list and do our homeworks by next time?
Agreed

## Other notes

Tale: Norwegian Pirate Party is building new member system, website, refreshing infrastructure so political work will get easier and faster in the future.

The swedish Pirate Party have their autumn GA right now
